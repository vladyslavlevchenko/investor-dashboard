# GitHub CI/CD Pipeline Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### ✅ Issue 1: Coverage Report Not Found
**Error**: `The report file pattern 'tests/**/coverage/coverage.opencover.xml' found no matching files.`

**Root Cause**: Coverage files were being generated in each test project's directory, but the report generator was looking in the wrong path.

**Fix**: Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
# Old path
-reports:tests/**/coverage/coverage.opencover.xml

# New path
-reports:**/coverage.opencover.xml
```

### ✅ Issue 2: File Encoding Errors
**Errors**:
- `/src/InvestorDashboard.Core/Class1.cs(1,1): error CHARSET: Fix file encoding.`
- `/src/InvestorDashboard.Infrastructure/Class1.cs(1,1): error CHARSET: Fix file encoding.`
- `/tests/InvestorDashboard.Tests.Unit/UnitTest1.cs(1,1): error CHARSET: Fix file encoding.`
- `/tests/InvestorDashboard.Tests.Integration/UnitTest1.cs(1,1): error CHARSET: Fix file encoding.`

**Root Cause**: Files had UTF-8 with BOM (Byte Order Mark) instead of UTF-8 without BOM.

**Fix**: Ran `dotnet format` which automatically fixed all encoding issues.

### ✅ Issue 3: Whitespace Formatting
**Error**: `/src/InvestorDashboard.Api/Program.cs(34,93): error WHITESPACE: Fix whitespace formatting.`

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent whitespace/line breaks.

**Fix**: Ran `dotnet format` which automatically fixed whitespace issues.

## Commits Made

1. **`1c8dc2e`**: `fix(ci): resolve GitHub Actions pipeline errors`
   - Fixed coverage report path pattern
   - Made OpenAPI generation more resilient
   - Improved error handling in pipeline

2. **`fc9cad2`**: `style: fix file encoding and whitespace formatting`
   - Fixed UTF-8 BOM issues in Class1.cs files
   - Fixed whitespace formatting in Program.cs
   - Ensured all files meet dotnet format requirements

---

## Verification

### Before Fix
```
❌ Coverage report generation - FAILED
❌ dotnet format check - FAILED (5 files with errors)
```

### After Fix
```
✅ Coverage report generation - Should work (once tests generate coverage)
✅ dotnet format check - PASSED (all files properly formatted)
```

## Commands Used

```powershell
# Fix formatting and encoding issues
dotnet format InvestorDashboard.sln

# Verify formatting
dotnet format --verify-no-changes --no-restore

# Stage changes
git add src/InvestorDashboard.Api/Program.cs
git add src/InvestorDashboard.Core/Class1.cs
git add src/InvestorDashboard.Infrastructure/Class1.cs
git add tests/InvestorDashboard.Tests.Integration/UnitTest1.cs
git add tests/InvestorDashboard.Tests.Unit/UnitTest1.cs

# Commit
git commit -m "style: fix file encoding and whitespace formatting"
```

## Next Steps

### To Push Changes to GitHub
```powershell
git push origin main
```

### To Verify CI Pipeline
After pushing:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Watch the CI pipeline run
4. All checks should now pass ✅

## Remaining CI Notes

### Coverage Threshold
The pipeline enforces 85% code coverage. Currently, we only have placeholder tests, so coverage will be low. This is expected for M0 (skeleton phase).

**Options**:
1. **Temporarily reduce threshold** in CI to 10% until M1
2. **Skip coverage check** for initial commits
3. **Accept failures** until real tests are added in M1

### Recommended: Temporarily Reduce Coverage Threshold

To allow M0 commit to pass, we could change in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
# Current
if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 85.0" | bc -l) )); then

# Temporary for M0
if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 10.0" | bc -l) )); then
```

After M1 is complete with real tests, change it back to 85%.

---

## Summary

✅ **Pipeline errors fixed**
✅ **Formatting errors fixed**
✅ **Ready to push**

The main blocker now is the **coverage threshold** (85%) which won't be met until we add real unit tests in Milestone M1.

**Recommendation**: Either temporarily lower the threshold or skip the coverage check for the M0 initial setup.

---

**Status**: Ready to push to GitHub (coverage threshold may need adjustment)

**Files Changed**: 6 files (5 formatted + 1 CI config)

**Commands to Push**:
```powershell
git push origin main
```
